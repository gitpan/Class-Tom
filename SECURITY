When TOM is used without Safe, there is no security. It is probably possible 
to breach any defense that you might attempt to put up. However,  when TOM is 
put into Safe mode it relies strictly on the security provided by the Safe
module.  If Safe is insecure, TOM is as well.  If Safe is secure, TOM
probably is, and if it isn't, I'd like to hear so that I can go about fixing
it so that it is.

Please, don't put blind faith in security.  Not with TOM, not with anything
else.
