Changes since 2.04 AlphaThree
-----------------------------
+ Made declare() work properly (was broken in AlphaThree).
+ Added methods() as defined in the POD (non-existant before).
+ rewrote test bench to cover more ground (!! must still do SAFE tests !!).
+ discovered bug in cleanup().
+ Added to POD.

Changes since 2.04 AlphaTwo
--------------------------
+ Addition of put_object() (spurkis@engsoc.carleton.ca)
+ Zapped potential security holes in cc(), declare(), and repair()
		(spurkis@engsoc.carleton.ca
+ Applied patches to make Agent and Tom more integrated.

Changes since 2.04 AlphaOne
---------------------------
+ Made Base64 support work properly.

Changes since 2.03
------------------
+ Have added Base64 support.  If you system has base64 it will use it,
otherwise it will default to using uuencode/uudecode.

Changes since 2.02
------------------
+ Have honestly, really removed requirement for protect.
+ Fixed bugs with the automagic insert (thanks spurkis@evilpeople.ml.org) 
+ I have removed demand and use.  If there is a demand for them, then they
  will reappear, but not otherwise.

Changes since 2.01
------------------
+ Altered Makefile.PL namespace
+ Added a couple of Demos, wrote README for it.
+ Removed the requirement for Protect from TOM.  If you have it, it
  uses it, if you don't it doesn't (not hard to understand).

Changes since 2.00
------------------
+ Capable of storing multiple objects.
+ class() method now exists.  It returns the class that the Tom
  container holds.
+ checksum() method now exists.
+ Tom namespace renamed to Class::Tom to conform to CPAN.

Changes since Beta 3
--------------------
+ Tom makes sure any inserted object belongs to the class contained within
  the Tom object.
+ Added documentation for the 'methods' method.
+ AutoInsertObjectModuleCompile (for want of a better name) now works.
+ Some methods are protected with protect (from .../CPAN/authors/id/JDUNCAN/)
+ Tom only optionally exports both 'cc' and 'repair'.  This is because
  Tom::Multiclass will also optionally exports 'cc' and 'repair'.
+ Smarter Makefile.PL - informs you if Tom will or will not work with
  the current system configuration.
+ make test available.
+ added a HINTS file to explain some ways of getting the most out of Tom.
+ killed the network stuff - the liklihood of anyone using such a primitive
  wrapper around IO::Socket is a) not very, and b) useless anyway.
+ perl5.004 required.
+ Tom should now run under strict, however, it is not recommended, as other
  peoples non-strictsafe code will cause errors.

Changes since Beta 2
--------------------
+ Handles both old Crypt::MD5 and newer MD5 transparently
+ Added a bit more documentation
+ API Change! READ THIS!
  repair no longer uses Package =>,  the first, and only argument to repair
  is simply a variable which is the stored Tom container.
+ Added the main compartment of Tom, similar to the main compartment in the
  1.0 distributions of Tom.
+ Added cc - compiles some modules.
+ redefine checking is no longer done.  If you are running unsecurely, your
  running unsecurely. And if you're running in a compartment, you can't
  redefine something outside of the compartment anyway.
+ Removed strict. It was holding me accountable for other peoples code, and 
  this is neither wise nor fun.
+ Framework for networking started.
+ Removed the 'send' method due to the last point.
+ Created a new fancy schmancy Makefile.PL.
+ Added a TODO list.


Since Beta 1
------------
+ Ability to securely register functions
+ Added require like Tom::demand package
+ You can now 'insert' an object into a container
  rather than 'declare_object'.
+ Checks for existing packages [undone in beta3]
+ Cleanup function added
+ Documentation updated.
+ Included old tomcc until cc is rewritten into Tom-2
+ Added simple streaming protocol to Tom.  I will re-write this into
  another file, with much more functionality soon.
