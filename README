Class::Tom 3.02
---------------
This is the second release of Class::Tom in the 3.00 series.  The 3.00 series 
is a complete rewrite of the module, and allows me to put some things into
place that should have gone into place a long time ago.

The API has been cleaned up,  and some pretty serious modifications as to
how Class::Tom works at a base level have occurred.

The biggest change of all is how a TOM object gets the code of a method.
By using B::Deparse and some hackery in the background, Tom now gets the
code of any subroutine directly from the perl interpreter itself.
However, one should note that while I have not encountered any problems
with B::Deparse,  there may be problems with it.

If you wish to submit bug reports regarding Class::Tom, or even make a
couple of suggestions, then you should probably send them to the
perl5-agents mailing list:

  perl5-agents@daft.com

To subscribe to the list, simply send mail to
perl5-agents-request@daft.com, with the words:

	subscribe <emailaddr>

in the body of the message.

Class::Tom is released under the same terms as perl itself.


Regards,
James
