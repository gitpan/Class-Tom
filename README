TOM Kit, Version 2.02 (Final Release)
-----------------------------
TOM allows you contain objects within a TOM object.  This TOM object can
then be flattened into a general container which can be passed from machine
to machine.  The objects stored inside the container can be used on any
machine with both Perl and Tom installed.

TOM has now been uploaded to CPAN, and some changes have been made because
of this.   It is now known as Class::Tom.  This is mainly to preserve
registered top-level heirarchies.

TOM is first updated at it's web page, which is located at
http://www.hawk.igs.net/~jduncan/Tom.  Info about upcoming releases, bug
fixes, etc can be found there.  

If you find a bug please don't hesitate to fix and send the patch to me :-)
If you just let me know where the bug crops up however, it should be plenty
enough for me.

A mailing list out there is appropriate for discussing Tom.  Subscribe to
perl5-agents-request@daft.com using the standard subscribe fred@foobar.com
syntax.  You can send mail to the list at perl5-agents@daft.com.

The other way to get help is to send mail directly to me:
