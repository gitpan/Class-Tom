To get an idea of how TOM works, do the following:

	1) Look at the code in both DemoSTART.pl and DemoEND.pl,
	   to make sure I'm not doing anything I shouldn't be.
	2) Run DemoSTART.pl to see what it prints, and the do it 
	   again, but this time redirect it's output to a file.
	3) Run DemoEND.pl with the argument being the file you
	   just created.  You'll see the script tell you how 
	   long ago it (approx) that you redirected the output from
	   the first script to the file.
	4) Now you get the idea, you should be able to figure out
	   more what the code does.
